- [ ] Continue trying to render summary page

    - [ ] investigate how to send the groups the user gave us from the app or the backend
    - [ ] consider different ways we want to render the component
        - [ ] maybe have adjustable width for the table text and annotation columns
        - [ ] set text to wrap around 
        // or allow them to scroll throw a cell.
        // I feel like the former is easier.

    - so far I'm just working off https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#data-table
