My todos from the js file are pasted here.
When complete, remember to cross off in both places!

- consider if we want to skip this step (4) 
and just go right to the annotator generating hypotheses

- link this page to AssistedGrouping

- add the next 2 steps of NLPDocTool to this branch and connect the pages.

- figure out how the model plays into this step, and how to pass openCodingModel instead
- in justicication text field box: return here when resolved model issue
    - this is temporarily commented out 
```js
Model.contextJustification = event.target.value
```
    so comeback when we've sorted out the business with the model.
