This section contains the saved labeled text results (both human-labeled and model-predicted), as well as python code for creating and saving bar plots of the results.

Results are saved in the form of a csv file with the following headers:

```
ID | TEXT | LABEL
```

`result_parser` provides a script that can convert csv outputs to bar plot Figures (see `__main__`), and save them to the `Figures` directory.
